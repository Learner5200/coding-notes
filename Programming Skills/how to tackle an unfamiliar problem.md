# Practical: tackling unfamiliar problem

1. Read the brief
2. Make a list of things you **don't** understand and need to research
3. Research
  * Google
    - find a *domain* and *key words* relating to that domain
    - consider translating into synonyms or breaking jargon down
  * Documentation
    - good to get into habit of going to documentation first: it should be the most accurate source, and you need the practice for when documentation is all there is
    - Look for examples of usage, or how to get hello world going
      - take a moment to try and understand/guess at/find out what each part does
      - very important when pairing to stop and take the time to read: even better if one of you then tries to explain back to the other person what they understand
4. Start **modelling** (e.g. diagramming) unless you have a strong understanding of the domain
  * ensures you have a conceptual understanding of the flow of code and not just a syntactic one
  * quickly shows up things you still don't understand, and helps get everyone on same page as far as model
  * the first interaction between two actors can be focused on as your first test
  * Use a diagram that represents **flow** rather than 'topography' (classes etc.)
5. Break down into stages
6. Come up with test for first stage
  * not necessarily writing a formal written test at this stage of understanding: just some form of validation
