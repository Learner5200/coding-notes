# Environments

* Local environment: just the environment on my machine
* Test environment: shared between developers, but meant to emulate the production environment
  - can play around, doesn't need to be neat

* Staging environment
  - somewhere in between test and production: as close to production as possible, but not disaster if it breaks
  - where stakeholders can have a look and see if it's what they want

* Public/production environment
  - the real deal
