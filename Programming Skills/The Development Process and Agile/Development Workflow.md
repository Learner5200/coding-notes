# Development Workflow

* Start with a spec
* Turn that into user stories
* Turn user stories into clear steps:
  - GitHub issues
  - trello posts
  - Key Q: what does 'ready' to start look like?
* Pick up the issue and create a branch on it with a sensible name
* Work with a pair on that branch
* Create pull request to master
* Get some feedback in comments section
  - Key Q: what does 'done' look like?
* When you get the go ahead (often a cake emoji), merge the PR into master
* (Optionally, set up a CI tool like travis to deploy to heroku etc)
* (If you have a live site, check the feature on there)



* **NB: keep README up to date!** Someone joining the team should be able to be productive after reading the README.
