* code should be **open** to extension
* code should be **closed** to modification


* if code is open-closed, then you should be able to add new stuff without modifying the old stuff!!

* rule of thumb: if you have a bunch of methods with the same suffix or prefix, there's a 'tortured object in there looking to get out'
