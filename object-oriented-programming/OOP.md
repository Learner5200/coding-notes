# Object-Oriented Programming

## What is OOP

* A **paradigm** for structuring code that models it as a system of **objects** passing **messages** to one another
* As far as possible
  - classes and methods are kept to a single responsibility
  - dependencies between objects are minimised
  - code is kept flexible so that it can be **re-used** and **easily changed**

## Why OOP

* OOP is a **style guide** for how to organise code, based on people's experience about how to avoid pain
* Code should be
  - easy to understand
  - easy to use
  - easy to re-use
  - easy to debug
  - easy to change
