# JUnit


## IntelliJ Shortcuts
* Can create a JUnit test file for a class in IntelliJ just by going all `alt+enter` on the class's name and asking it to create a test case.
* `CTRL+SHIFT+T` toggles between test and production code.
* Loads more - look them up as and when!

## Patterns

* One simple pattern:

```
int expected = _____
int actual = ______
assertEquals(expected, actual)
```


## TDD

* Remember, a failure to even compile counts as a failure for TDD purposes.
