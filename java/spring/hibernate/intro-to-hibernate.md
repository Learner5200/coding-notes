# Hibernate

# What is it

* An **ORM** for Java.
  - i.e. a framework for persisting/saving Java objects into a database
  - Handles all the low level SQL (JDBC) code to save you headaches
    - just a layer of abstraction on top of JDBC, which is how people used to do database stuff
  - Maps Java objects into rows of a database table
* Great for CRUD apps
