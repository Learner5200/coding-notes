# Aspect Oriented Programming

* Think of **aspects** as the unit of modularity.
* Allow the modularisation of certain concerns (e.g. logging, transaction management) - **crosscutting concerns** - that cut across multiple types and objects
* Spring implements these as classes with the `@Aspect` annotation
