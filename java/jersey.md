# Jersey

* A framework for developing REST services in Java, using the `JAX-RS API` (which I think is Java's own API for doing REST stuff)
  - Jersey is a 'reference implementation' for JAX-RS: a concrete implementation of a particular specification/standard that demonstrates the concepts, usually by the same people that made the specification
* I guess this is an alternative to Spring etc. for REST stuff?
