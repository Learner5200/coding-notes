# JavaDocs

* The **Javadoc tool** generates API documentation from comments present in the source code.
* Javadoc comments look like regular multiline comments with an extra star:

```
/**
 * This is a Javadoc
 */
```

* Two sections:
  - description of what we're commenting on
  - block tags (in-line or standalone) containing metadata: e.g. `@author Captain America`
