# Desk

* A tool for flipping back and forth between different **project contexts** in the shell
  - "Change directory, activate a virtualenv or rvm, load in domain-specific aliases, environment variables, functions, arbitrary shell files, all in a single command."
* Namespaces various shell aliases and functions under a particular 'desk'
* Very simple
  - "Basically, desk just associates a shell script (name.sh) with a name. When you call desk . name, desk drops you into a shell where name.sh has been executed, and then desk extracts out certain comments in name.sh for useful rendering."
  - so
