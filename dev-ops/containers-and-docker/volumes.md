# Volumes

* Allow you to set up a reference from inside a container to a particular directory running on your machine
* Can use the -v flag when doing docker run, or put it in your docker-compose file
* NB: volumes only exist once the container has been built

* can specify particular directories NOT to use volumes for, too
