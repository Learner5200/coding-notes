# Cron Jobs

* Cron (as in cronic) jobs are commands scheduled to run at a particular time.
* Typically used on unix for things like:
  - scheduled backups
  - monitoring disk space
  - deleting files when no longer needed
  - maintenance tasks
* Kubernetes uses the term in the same way: **periodic/recurring tasks**
*
