# Namespaces

* Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.
* Namespaces provide a scope for the names of resources
* Namespaces let you divide and manage the same physical cluster, segregating it for use by different dev teams, or for different purposes (e.g. dev and prod)



* Key thing is: same cluster (of physical machines) can have several namespaces on it, corresponding to different environments
