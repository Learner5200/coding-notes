# Apache Hadoop

* Software for storing and processing large datasets
* Stores data in a cluster (**Hadoop Distributed File System**)
  - lets you store files that are larger than what can be stored on any one node/computer
* Processes the data with something called **MapReduce**
  - moves the processing software to where the data is rather than vice verser -> brings just the answer back
    - distributes processing, which is a lot faster
