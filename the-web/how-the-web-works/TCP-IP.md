# TCP/IP

* Technically two different protocols - TCP and IP - but often treated as one thing.
* TCP divides a message into packets that get transmitted and re-assembled.
* IP is responsible for addressing each packet so that it gets to the right place.
* Technically divided into four layers of protocols

## Datalink layer

* Protocols for connecting hosts/nodes in the network. e.g. Ethernet, ARP


## Networking layer

* Connects independent networks to transport packets of data across network boundaries.
* e.g. IP, ICMP

## Transport layer

* Handles communications between hosts: responsible for flow control, reliability, multiplexing
e.g. TCP, UDP

## Application Layer

* Standardises data exchange for applications.
* e.g. HTTP, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for email)
