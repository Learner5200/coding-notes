# Forms

* html forms allow the user to send a new request to the server with certain params, using a button.
* Giving your form text inputs a 'name' field will turn whatever name you give it into a parameter, and whatever value they type in the box into the value of that parameter.
* Submitting will send the request (of the type you specify, defaulting to GET) with the parameters added
