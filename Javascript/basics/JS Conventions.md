* use camelCase instead of snake_case for variable and method names

* no '?'s in method names: predicate methods tend to be written like 'dog.isPurebreed'

* private methods begin with an underscore

* Constants are written in all caps, though this is only a convention in JS


* Use === instead of == unless you have a good reason not to
