# Destructuring Assignment

* A shortcut way of assigning variables that's very useful for copying objects, or getting parameters out of an object passed to a function.

## With Arrays

```
const array = [1, 2, 3];
[a, b, c] = array;
a === 1
b === 2
c === 3
```

## With Objects

```
const object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
{ a, b, c } = object
a === 1
b === 2
c === 3
```
