## Intro

* JS doesn't do as much for you as Ruby does - much less 'syntactic sugar'
  - can be frustrating: you have to build the tools you want yourself, understand how things work.


## OOP in JS

* Javascript is technically a functional language, but most modern development treats it as an OO language
  - ES6 (not covered in this course) even has a class keyword->



## ES6

* Course materials dont cover this yet, BUT should probably try to learn it on the side if possible
* Plenty of legacy code out there will use ES5, so good to known both
