# Data Science

## Tools

* Python
   - Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`
* R
* Maybe SAS/SPSS etc
* Matlab
* Hadoop
* SQL/noSQL
* Cloud data storage


## Techniques

* ALL OF STATISTICS
* Clustering

## Purpose

* Turning **large amounts** of **messy data** into **predictions** and **actionable advice**
* Several major stages here:
  - clarifying/discussing requirements, business need, etc.
  - getting the data needed (perhaps from several sources) and wrangling/cleaning it until it's something we can work with
  - coding up a predictive model from this data
  - presenting the findings through writeups, visualisations, presentations, etc.


* Will involve a lot of problem solving
  - how clean is this data?
  - how can we reduce bias/error?

## Activities

* Working with data:
  - pulling data
  - merging data
    - often have to 'wrangle' together data from multiple sources to serve as a good basis for making predictions
  - cleaning data
  - analysing data
  - finding patterns/trends
  - developing and testing algorithms
  - developing and testing predictive models
* Coding
  - mostly in Python or R
  - Jupyter notebooks
* Presenting data:
  - building data visualisations
  - writing up results
* _Sometimes_ collecting data:
  - A/B testing

* Communication:
  - understanding the business need/big picture
  - meetings
  - responding to emails
  - explaining the data/model in way that layman can understand
  - explaining e.g. what kind of information you'll need to do what
  - clarifying requirements
  - arguing about tradeoffs


* Review
  - reviewing models
  - reviewing code

* Learning
  - Reading articles/blogs
  - attending conferances

* Example data sources:
  - Instagram likes
  - Tesco clubcard data

## Work-Life Balance

* Pretty good I think: 9-5ish not unusual


## What you need

* Programming skills, esp. in Python etc.
  - OOP
* Maths/statistics: either background or ability to learn it
  - Statistics: mostly stuff I already know actually
  - Calculus: know most of the stuff you need already I think
  - Linear algebra:  doesn't sound too bad, I know most of the basics already
* Problem solving skills
