# Mobile Development

## Overview

* Creating mobile apps for iOS, Android and other devices
* Tech stack could be Swift, Java/Kotlin, React Native, or something else
* Involves both design/creativity and problem solving-->maybe leans a little more front end
  - depending on the app, can involve a lot of UI considerations
* Teams are often small: can often end up working across concerns


### Pros

* Can be kind of nifty to be making something you can deploy straight onto your phone and show people
* Opportunity for integration with cool stuff like location, calendar, body metrics, etc.
  - Therefore more likely to encounter behavioural science applications - the kind of applications that integrate with your life

### Cons

* Maybe a bit too UI/design focused - a lot of the logical heavy lifting probably happens on the back end/server
  - **ACTION: find out how UI focused it is**
