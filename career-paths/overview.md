# Overview

## Different specialisms:

### Web Development

* The largest group
* Broadly split into:
  - front-end: UI and UI-logic
  - back-end: databases and low level operations
  - middleware: business rules/logic
* full stack developers do all of these things
  - useful to specialise in a specific stack of technologies if you're going to be a full-stack developer

### Mobile Development

* Apps for phones, tablets, sometimes app-enabled TVs/wearables

### Desktop software

* Not what it used to be, now that everything is in the cloud or on mobile
* Just about still a viable career choice

### Video games

* Viable
* BUT difficult:
  - lots of competition
  - long hours

### Embedded systems

* A lot of machines/things have brains in them now.
* Typically work on real-time operating systems which run inside of electronics
* In demand, and requires a specialised skillset.

### Data science

* About extracting useful information out of large amounts of data.
* Will require maths/statistics
* Often involves custom programs to extract, manipulate, re-organise data
* New-ish, and lucrative.

### Cloud

* Mostly (but not always) cloud applications are also web applications
* Need to understand how the cloud works, especially RE scalability, availability

### Test automation

* Writing automated tests

## Freelancing

* A different kind of SWE career.
* A developer who works as a 'hired gun' for whatever client they choose to work for.

## DevOps

* The interface between software development and business requirements
* Manage the continuous delivery and deployment of software
* Think about things like containers/Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins jobs
