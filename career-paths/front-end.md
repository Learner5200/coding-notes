# Front End Development

## Overview

* Developing the user interface of an application
  - the designers have already decided how it should look - your job is to implement that
* Centres around HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Any code that runs on the client/browser-side, rather than the server
* These days, typically implies familiarity with a front-end framework: React, Angular, Vue

* Many now divide into two categories:
  - front-end engineers: functional javascript work using a framework, may include some middleware
  - front-end styler/visualiser: visual work focusing on DOM structure/optimisation, CSS, javascript interaction work

## Where they fit in

* Bridge between back-end programmers and designers

## Skills needed

* Need to be both creative and tech-savvy
  - ability to collaborate with technical back end engineers and designers/UX specialists
* Awareness of user experience

  - e.g. Cypress
* Unit testing
  - varies where this comes in on front-end, rarely TDD


## What it's like

* The usual:
  - emails
