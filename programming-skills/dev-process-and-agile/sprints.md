# Sprints

* Units of work, aligned to specific goals, to be achieved in a specific, small amount of time
* Sprints will be two days on this project (normally 1-2 weeks)

## Step One - Planning Session

* estimate size of issues
  - better to measure **not** in terms of time, but complexity: small, medium, large
  -
* prioritize
* assign

## Step Two - Implementation
* Move cards to 'To Do'
* Pair to implement them

## Step Three - Retrospective
* What went well, badly, etc
* What will we do differently next time
