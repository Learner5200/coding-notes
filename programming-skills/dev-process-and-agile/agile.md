# Agile

## Agile Principles (from the manifesto)

### PEOPLE: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Build projects around motivated individuals -> give them the support/environment needed to succeed.
* Self-organising teams
* Frequent, face-to-face communication (e.g. standups/retros)
* Regular **reflection** on how to become more effective

### PRACTICALITY: Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Early and continuous/frequent delivery
* Sustainable development - maintain the same pace
* Working software as primary measure of progress

### FLEXIBILITY: Responding to change over following a plan

* Welcome **changing requirements** - key synergy with OOP
* **Simplicity**: maximise the amount of work not done
* Attention to technical excellence and good design
*

### COLLABORATION WITH CLIENTS: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Developers working with business people


## Extreme Programming

* XP values are a related set of principles:
  1. Simplicity
  2. Communication
  3. Feedback (from tests and customer)
  4. Respect (others and self - dont delay work of peers; appreciate team)
  5. Courage (throw things away when needed; persist; refactor)
* Largely come from Kent Beck
* Proponents of
  - TDD
  - pair programming
  - listening
  - designing

## Scrum

* Most widely used process framework (set of practices etc) for agile.
  - like an implementation of the philosophy
  - More or less how we've done it at Makers
* Moves in **sprints**, with daily **scrum meetings** (standups), building stuff **iteratively**
* Work from **user stories** to features

## Kanban

* Another popular agile framework
* Focused on **modelling workflow** visually on a **kanban board** (I guess like Trello or Waffle):
  - can see where you are, what needs to be done
  - can identify inefficiencies and improve them
* Can mix and match this with scrum stuff like Makers do


## Why Agile?

* More **responsive** to changing requirements - great for client/customers
* Less wastage - removes non-productive work, can focus on what is most efficient
* Optimises use of people in the team
